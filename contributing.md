# How to contribute
Contributions keep a project, that would otherwise die, alive. To contribute, you'll need to follow some guidelines.

## Getting Started

- Make sure you have a [Github](https://github.com/) account.
- Submit the issue, if it isn't already reported,  preferably through Waffle.
    - Describe the issue, or improvement. If it is an error, try to provide code, or steps to reproduce.
- Fork and clone the repository.
- Run any required build scripts (None exist yet)

## Making Changes
- Create a new branch to work off of, making it easier to go back, and to merge.
- Make commits often.
    - Make commit messages meaningful.
- Make sure you have tests to support your addition
- Make sure all already built tests pass
- Simple changes, such as typos, or documentation, don't require issues to be made, or new branches.
- Make sure all changes comply to style guides. Use Pylint as a basis.

## Submitting Changes
- Push your change to your new branch in your fork of the program.
- Create a Pull Request.
- Update the issue with the link to the request.
- The request shall be accepted or declined after some time.
